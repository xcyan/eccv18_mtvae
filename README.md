# MT-VAE for Multimodal Human Motion Synthesis

This is the code for ECCV 2018 paper [MT-VAE: Learning Motion Transformations to Generate Multimodal Human Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04545) by Xinchen Yan, Akash Rastogi, Ruben Villegas, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Eli Shechtman, Sunil Hadap, Ersin Yumer, Honglak Lee.

Please follow the instructions to run the code.

## Requirements
MT-VAE requires or works with
* Mac OS X or Linux
* NVIDIA GPU

## Installing Dependency
* Install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* Note: this implementation has been tested with [TensorFlow 1.3](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.3/).

## Data Preprocessing
* For Human3.6M dataset, please download the [pre-processed dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVbJaLQNEe2VFoioXG6QcckSVxMRTCRJ/view?usp=sharing).
```
bash prep_human36m_joints.sh
```
* Disclaimer: Please check the license of [Human3.6M dataset](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php) if you download this preprocessed version.

## Training (MT-VAE)
* If you want to train the MT-VAE human motion generator, please run the following script (usually it takes 1 day with a single Titan GPU).
```
bash demo_human36m_trainMTVAE.sh
```
* Alternatively, you can download the pre-trained MT-VAE model, please run the following script.
```
bash prep_human36m_model.sh
```

## Motion Synthesis Using Pre-trained MT-VAE Model
* Please run the following command to generate multiple diverse human motion given initial motion.
```
bash demo_human36m_inferMTVAE.sh
```

## Motion Analogy-making Using Pre-trained MT-VAE Model
* Please run the following command to execute motion analogy-making.
```
bash demo_human36m_analogyMTVAE.sh
```
## Hierchical Video Synthesis Using Pre-trained Image Generation Model
* Please download [full Human3.6M videos](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php) into the workspace/Human3.6M/ folder.
* We use a pre-trained model from the [ICML 2017 HierchVid Repository](https://github.com/rubenvillegas/icml2017hierchvid). Please run the following command for image synthesis given generated motion sequence.
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICE=0 python h36m_hierach_gensample.py
```
* Disclaimer: Please double check the license in that repository and cite [HierchVid paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05831) when use.
